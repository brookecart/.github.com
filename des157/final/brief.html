        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.simonphipps.co.uk/">SimonPhipps.co.uk</a></h3>
        <p>
          I think this website is similar to mine because of the implied theme.
          There is very little text but the photographs are self explanatory and
          aided by the text that is present on the screen (this seems like
          someone’s personal photography project on industrial structures). I
          think the staggered images in each column adds a sense of story to
          the site, and subtly encourages the user to explore more down the
          page. The images are not immediately apparent to be interactable,
          but hovering over them prompts them to move slightly and reveal a
          caption. I think this subtle interaction fits well with the overall
          understated nature of the site.

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://carolinedussuel.com/">CarolineDussel.com</a></h3>
        <p>
          This website is very similar to my concept. When the user hovers over
          a stack of pictures, the top image changes and a title appears next
          to the cursor. Clicking on a stack expands it in the space and the
          other stacks are moved out of the way slightly. Then when the stack
          is expanded, the user can hover over each image, which will become
          larger. I think this site is less than straightforward in the sense
          that the content on the page is constantly changing with every hover
          over an image. Content is pushed around too much and I think it
          weakens any strong focal point. I also didn’t like the title that
          appears on hover over a collapsed image stack. I thought it was hard
          to read as it moved around with the cursor, coupled with the fact the
          black text laid over the dark colors in a lot of the images.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want to resolve the original issues I had with my code, which was
          the stack not being able to expand on a second click. I also want to
          try to get an infinite scrolling effect on an expanded stack of
          polaroids. In the browser, this will basically lock the user into
          viewing that stack of pictures until they elect to collapse it again,
          and I think this will center and guide the user’s attention (which
          the second Comparison Project struggled with). I also want to try to
          incorporate captions with each photo to provide some context. I want
          to utilize a subtle, understated interaction for this like the first
          Comparison Project.

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          I will adhere closely to my original visual design because I think
          that was successful. The minimalist colors and text choices aided in
          adding simplicity to my overall interface and allowed the user to
          focus on the main aspect of the project, which was the photographs. I
          think the first landing page can be reworked to be more interesting,
          or indicate better to the user to scroll down and explore more
          content. I will try to use some larger text for the subtitle to fill
          more of the negative space, and I might experiment with a downward
          pointing arrow to indicate to the user to scroll.

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          I also like the feel of my original interactions. I incorporated
          scroll snap into my scrollable content because it highlighted the
          content that I wanted the user to focus on and provided reliable,
          consistent focal points. However to incorporate the captions onto my
          photos I’m thinking I might be able to extend the polaroid theme by
          flipping the polaroids over and giving a handwriting font to the text
          captions to make it seem more personal. I wonder if doing a CSS
          “flip” would feel out of place, and in that case I would want to
          explore an interaction similar to that in my first Comparison
          Project, where the image pushes out of the way slightly to reveal the
          caption. I also wanted to make the polaroid stack opening/collapsing
          animated so that it doesn’t happen all at once but images slide out
          from the stack in a gentler way, maybe one at a time.

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want the overall experience to feel simple, clean, and elegant,
          with special emphasis on the images. To achieve this I will develop
          strong focal points and subtle, pleasant interactions that will avoid
          performing anything instantly. I also don’t want to place too much
          burden on the cognitive load so I will make the captions that I
          incorporate minimal and sentimental to further the nostalgic
          impression. Other than that I will try to remain true to my original
          design, as I received positive feedback on that in my peer reviews
          and from the instructor. I think this approach to the visual design
          will elevate my goals for the interface feeling light and clean.
