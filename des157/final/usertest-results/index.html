        <h2>Landing Area Title</h2>
        <p>
          It became clear through user testing that the effect on mouse move I
          had implemented to the landing area of my site was too subtle. Certain
           users were even confused by the effect. They weren’t sure if it was
           their movement that was causing it or if it was moving on its own.
           Others didn’t notice it at all until I asked them to give me feedback
            on it. However I think it succeeded conceptually; when I asked for
            feedback, users had positive reactions. I received comments that it
            was a pleasant effect and added interest to the page. It became
            clear after testing that I would have to make this more obvious to
            users on first glance. I will implement this by increasing the speed
             of the effect.

        <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
        <p>
          The second question I asked users in our follow up session was how
          they received the colors of the interface. All users reacted
          positively to the color scheme. They stated that the simplicity was
          appropriate for the overall theme, and it allowed the page to flow
          well. One user suggested that it might be improved with a “theme” on
          each section by pulling out a mutual, unifying color from the
          photographs and giving that section’s background the same color. I
          thought it was an interesting concept. I had also received a comment
          like that in one of my other feedback sessions, that as the viewport
          moved down the page, if I might make the background move down a
          gradient as well. If I were to implement this, off the top of my head
          I think I could do it in Javascript. I could basically assign color
          stops on a gradient at every increment of the viewport height.

        <h2>Infinite Scrolling Bug</h2>
        <p>
          I had a bug in my code that created a lot of negative reactions to my
          project. I thought I had resolved this bug before the session, so I
          was surprised and disappointed to see it persist in the user tests.
          Essentially, when a user opens up a photo stack and scrolls, it can
          have buggy behavior where when the user scrolls, a bunch of different
          polaroids flash across the screen. My users responded in various
          ways, but all were very confused, and one was really surprised when
          it glitched. I think they wondered at first if it was supposed to do
          that or not, because only when I mentioned that was a bug, did they
          have a moment of realization. I’m going to have to continue to debug
          this and see where exactly the issue lies, but my first thought is
          that it has something to do with the condition I have set for the
          script to detect if the user has scrolled.
