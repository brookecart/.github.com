        <h2>Modals</h2>
        <h3>Thursday, January 28 - Week 4</h3>
        <p>
          I thought it was interesting to see examples of modals that were not used as pop-ups or spam, and instead for main functionality, like logins, or creating tweets. I hadn’t even thought of these as modals, because I think I formed an inherent association with modals and being annoying or irrelevant. It made me reconsider how to tastefully use modals, especially with consideration to back-tracking and escaping. I think being able to easily escape a modal is important visually, as denoted by an ‘x’ or a similar symbol, and also for users that navigate by keyboard to be able to escape quickly by the ‘esc’ button. Otherwise, I think a modal can probably feel claustrophobic. And as with any aspect design, I think it also applies that when everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized. Modals should be used sparingly to have the desired effect.

        <h2>Form Design</h2>
        <h3>Thursday, January 21 - Week 3</h3>
        <p>
          From a usability perspective, forms seem to be an inherent nightmare. Based on the sheer length of this article, there are clearly a lot of ways that forms can be suboptimal for the user experience. I feel that a lot of these practices pertain to either communicating functionality and error handling to users, or creating an appealing, manageable flow. I often feel frustrated with form design on the internet, so I thought all of this information was really valuable to me as a designer. My primary goal for my form designs is to best integrate the accessibility features, such as tab navigation, and other more general practices like adequate contrast and the use of more than just color to communicate statuses.
